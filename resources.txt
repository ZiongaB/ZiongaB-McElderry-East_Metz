This is a list of resources we used regarding code and images

Code:
-When it came to the code we did use some snippets and ideas from both w3 schools
and the textbook. (Zach ended up using some snippets from the previous exam code)

https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_button_on_image.asp
https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_validation.asp
https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar_vertical.asp

This was used as well for making the facebook iframe work
https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/page-plugin/


Images: 

-Food images came from a mix of photos taken by other students a number come from google images that are CCL (Can't find the original sources anymore but they were CCL I believe)
-Various imagescame from the Metz or NCF site. (EX: Logos,NCF Pantry Image, Catering Image)
-One image came from https://pixahive.com/photo/feedback-with-emoji/
